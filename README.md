clojurego
=========

Attempt to write basic clojure datastructure in go-lang.

TODO
====
Basically all.

[] List
[] Maps
[] Sets

Need to think how manage all, it is just a ery early stage idea.

Help is very welcome, since I am not really proficient in GO, and I should be more proficient in clojure to.
