clojurego
=========

Attempt to write basic clojure data structures in go-lang.

TODO
====
Everything:

- [ ] List
- [ ] Maps
- [ ] Sets
- [ ] Functions (are functions data-structure ?)
- [ ] Something I have miss for sure

Need to think how manage all, it is just a ery early stage idea.

Help is very welcome, since I am not really proficient in GO, and I should be more proficient in clojure to.
