clojurego
=========

Attempt to write basic clojure data structures in go-lang.

TODO
====
Everything from (here)[http://clojure.org/data_structures]:

- [ ] nil
- [ ] Numbers
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Characters
- [ ] Keywords
- [ ] Symbols
- [ ] Collections:
-- [ ] List
-- [ ] Vector
-- [ ] Maps
-- [ ] StructMaps
-- [ ] ArrayMaps
-- [ ] Sets

Need to think how manage all, it is just a very early stage idea.

Help is very welcome, since I am not really proficient in GO, and I should be more proficient in clojure to.
